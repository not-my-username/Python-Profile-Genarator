# Python Profile Image Generator

This is a group of profile picture generators written in python. Each pattern generator is a different file. They can be used individually or using main.py as a GUI or shell script.

## Supported Patterns: 

1. Streaks      (diagonal lines of the same colour)
2. Mirror       (a random pattern mirrored on the x-axis)
3. 4-Way Mirror      (a random pattern mirrored on the x and y axis )


## Running as a native application 

This program can be run as an application, although binaries are not available, so you will need to convert it to yourself using the following instruction  for your os
